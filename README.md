# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning
# 📌 Overview
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based web application that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on various soil and environmental parameters. By entering values such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall, users can receive an AI-driven crop recommendation to maximize agricultural yield.

# 🎯 Features
- User Input Form: Users can enter soil and climate parameters.
- Machine Learning Prediction: The system uses a trained ML model to predict the best crop.
- Bootstrap UI: A clean and responsive UI for easy user interaction.
- Real-time Recommendation: Instantly suggests the most suitable crop based on input.
- Dynamic Results Display: Shows the recommended crop with an image for better visualization.
  
# 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Database: CSV dataset for training
- Deployment: Can be hosted on Render, Heroku, or AWS
